# Project Name

Server Side Calculator

## Description

Duration: Weekend Project

This calculator was built to use a user interface where a user can input two values and the select type of mathematical operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division). A clear button was created to clear the user input fields. History is tracked below of previous calculation inputs.

Stretch goals were met to create an interface more similar to a real calculator and use the buttons to create a string of equation rather than the objects of two values and one operation. A delete button was added to clear the history of previous calculations, along with the ability to click on a previous historical entry to re-run.

## Built With

Visual Studio Code
JQuery
GitHub
